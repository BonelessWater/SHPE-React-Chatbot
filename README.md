# React Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a React project from scratch using `create-react-app`.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your React project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: React requires Node.js to run. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm or yarn**: Both npm (which comes with Node.js) and yarn can be used as package managers for a React project. Choose one to use for this guide.
   - To verify if npm is installed, run: 
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - To verify if yarn is installed, run: 
     ```bash
     yarn -v
     ```

## Getting Started

### 1. Install `create-react-app`

`create-react-app` is an officially supported command-line tool to set up a new React project. Install it globally if you haven't already.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
